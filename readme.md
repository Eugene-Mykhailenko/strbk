After checkout this project from version control install all dependencies using **YARN**, not NPM!

In case yarn is not installed on your machine:
```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

Then navigate to ui-kit's prject directory and run:
```bash
yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies see `package.json` for available commands. You may run them with npm, all will work ok (it supposed to).
